title: Working Groups
---

The main mechanism of promoting material change in Boulder DSA is through our _working groups._ Everyone is welcome to join any amount of working groups, and most working groups have tasks for people with little to no organizational experience.  We could use your help to make the world a better place, so please choose one group to attend!

# Labor
The Labor working group focuses on supporting workers in their struggle to gain power at work.  They help support union actions, help form unions, and campaign for more worker protections. 
### What kind of work do they do?
The Labor committee trains their members to be union organizers, installs salts in workplaces, provides material and solidarity to union actions as well as provide community training for unfair labor practices.
